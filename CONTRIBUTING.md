3. Make your changes following our coding standards
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Commit with conventional commit messages
6. Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive function names
- Prefix all functions with relevant namespace (e.g., `dc` for docker-compose)
- Use snake_case for internal variables
- Use kebab-case for file names

### Function Structure
```bash
# Function description
function_name() {
  # Validate inputs
  if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
    echo "❌ Usage: function_name <param>"
    return 1
  fi
  
  # Main logic
  echo "🔄 Executing command..."
  
  # Error handling
  if ! command; then
    echo "❌ Command failed"
    return 1
  fi
}
```

### Documentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include usage examples in function help
- Update README.md for new features
- Add emoji indicators for better UX

## 🧪 Testing

Before submitting:
1. Test all new functions manually
2. Ensure no existing functionality is broken
3. Test on different environments if possible
4. Verify help messages are accurate
